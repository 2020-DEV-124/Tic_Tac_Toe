## Description
<!--description-->

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O. It is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player's goal is to make 3 in a row. 

The rules are described below :

* X always goes first.
* Players cannot play on a played position.
* Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
    * One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
    * All nine squares are filled.
* If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
* If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
